      * Expand the zip file into some directory, e.g c:\statcvs
      * Check out the desired CVS module into some directory,
        e.g. c:\myproject.
      * Change into that directory and type 'cvs log > cvslog'
      * Change back to the c:\statcvs directory
      * type 'java -jar statcvs.jar c:\myproject\cvslog c:\myproject'
