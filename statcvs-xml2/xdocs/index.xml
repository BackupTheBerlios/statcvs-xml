          StatCvs-XML provides reports about cvs usage based on the
          cvs log. It is an extension of the great <a
          href="http://statcvs.sf.net/">StatCvs</a>
          project. StatCvs-XML shares the cvs log parsing code with
          StatCvs but has advanced report generation and customization
          features:

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Colorful 3D charts to visualize project progress</li>
            <li>Extensive tables with statistical data</li>
            <li>Highly customizable reports through parameterization
            and scritability</li>
            <li>Accurate analysis through history feature</li>
            <li>Seamless integration with <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>         

        <p>
          Here is an example of the <a
          href="/statcvs-xml-html/index.html">default output</a>
          generated by StatCvs-XML when run on the StatCvs-XML
          repository.

          Please read the <a href="/manual/index.html">manual</a> on
          how to use StatCvs-XML. If you are eager to try it you can
          simply download the full jar and run the following commands
          in your project directory: 
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li><tt>cvs log &gt; cvs.log</tt></li>
            <li><tt>java -jar statcvs-xml-full.jar</tt></li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          This will generate a bunch of html documents in a directory
          <code>statcvs-xml-out/</code>.

	  <section name="History">

        <p>
          StatCvs-XML was started in 2003 by Tammo van Lessen and
          Steffen Pingel, both studying Software Engineering at the
          University of Stuttgart at the time. The primary goal of the
          project was to provide suitable output xdoc for <a
          href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>. The
          original StatCvs was only capable of generating html output
          which did not integrate well with the project documentation
          generated by Maven.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first StatCvs-XML release was heavily based on the
          StatCvs code base. It basically was an adoption of the
          output layer to generate an intermediate XML representaion
          using JDOM that was later transformed to xdoc or html
          through a stylesheet.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second release focused on merging enhancements of the
          input layer from StatCvs and on a more abstract,
          customizable output layer. 
        </p>

        <p>Besides hacking on StatCvs-XML, the developers also
        enhanced the <a href="/maven-plugin/">Maven StatCvs
        Plug-In</a> to make use of the enhanced StatCvs-XML
        features. Acctually the orginal version of the plugin made use
        of StatCvs, but has been changed to use StatCvs-XML instead,
        since the Maven 1.0-rc1 release.</p>
