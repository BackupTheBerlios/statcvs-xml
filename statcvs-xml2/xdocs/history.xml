        <p>
          StatCvs-XML was started in 2003 by Tammo van Lessen and
          Steffen Pingel, both studying Software Engineering at the
          University of Stuttgart at the time. The primary goal of the
          project was to provide suitable output xdoc for <a
          href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>. The
          original StatCvs was only capable of generating html output
          which did not integrate well with the project documentation
          generated by Maven.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first StatCvs-XML release was heavily based on the
          StatCvs code base. It basically was an adoption of the
          output layer to generate an intermediate XML representaion
          using JDOM that was later transformed to xdoc or html
          through a stylesheet.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second release focused on merging enhancements of the
          input layer from StatCvs and on a more abstract,
          customizable output layer. 
        </p>

        <p>Besides hacking on StatCvs-XML, the developers also
        enhanced the <a href="/maven-plugin/">Maven StatCvs
        Plug-In</a> to make use of the enhanced StatCvs-XML
        features. Acctually the orginal version of the plugin made use
        of StatCvs, but has been changed to use StatCvs-XML instead,
        since the Maven 1.0-rc1 release.</p>
